# GoOrg - From Goals to Organisations: automated organisation design method (Project)

This is the implementation of GoOrg ([PAAMS'19](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-24299-2_28) and [EMAS'19](http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~lad/emas2019/accepted/EMAS2019_paper_5.pdf) papers available) project. GoOrg is a method for automatic creation of organisations. This demand comes from complex projects of multiple systems working in a coordinated way in order to achieve mutual goals which are situations where Multi-Agent Systems are often applied. To design such systems it is necessary to define how they will work together, i.e., how they will be organised which can be a tough task for humans encharged for the design of the whole system. To track this problem and help humans to easier develop Multi-Agent Systems we propose GoOrg for generating the organisational structure of the system.

## Running and testing

To run it use `./gradlew run`. It should grab all dependencies of the project and run a very simple example which is a small goals tree asking for the most specialist roles, which is generating an organisational chart similar to the given goals tree, i.e., one role to perform each goal.

A graphviz representation (.gv file) of the input and of the output should be created in the folder `output/diagrams`. For search for one solution only, it is generated by default the PNG of the gdt and the solution in the folder `output/graphs`. For generating PDF of all .gv files, in \*nux systems, assuming it has `dot` installed, just run the script `./createPDF.sh`. The pdf files also go to `output/graphs`. The results are also stored in a statistic file in `output/statistics`, each row representing a solution found. The id corresponds to the id of created graphviz representation. Each time it runs the algorithm clean the output folders, so to keep the results it is necessary to make a copy before a running again. 

In the class SimpleLogger there is a setting for printing output to standard console or to a file called `log.log` that is stored in the project root folder.

To run the simple embedded example with other cost functions and search approaches leave the first argument as "0" and use the second argument to select a cost function (see cost enumeration in javadocs for details) and the third argument to the search approach (BFS for Breadth First Search, DFS for Depth First Search or A*). Examples:

```
$ ./gradlew run --args="0 GENERALIST"
$ ./gradlew run --args="0 SPECIALIST DFS"
```

To run other examples just refer to the corresponding moise organisational description file, choosing cost function and search approach. Examples: 

```
$ ./gradlew run --args="examples/Paint_House.xml FLATTER BFS"
$ ./gradlew run --args="examples/Full_Link.xml TALLER DFS"
```

It is available an integrated test of all cost functions among other unit tests. For running these tests getting text output, execute:

```
$ ./gradlew test -i
```

## Project status and roadmap

Currently, the project is using as input a goal decomposition tree with skills annotated on it. There are four possible transformations which is (i) for creating the root role, (ii) for creating subordinates, (iii) for joining a subordinate into an existing role, and (iv) for joining a pair into an existing role. Next version will add more annotation in order to improve the roles creation process which will allow the creation of coordinatiors, departments and so on.

## Eclipse developers
To add this project to eclipse use Import > Gradle > Existing Gradle Project.
